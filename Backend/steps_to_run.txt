JANSAKSHI – HOW TO RUN & WHAT DOES WHAT (Human Explanation)

---

1. FIRST TIME SETUP (only once)

---

Step 1: Install packages
Open terminal inside the backend folder and run:

pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dotenv

Step 2: Create the database
Run:

python setup.py

This will create a file called DATA_DB.db.
This is where all government project data is stored.

Step 3: Create .env file
Inside backend folder create a file named:

.env

Put your API key inside it like this:

SARVAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
SARVAM_API_URL=https://your-api-endpoint
SARVAM_MODEL=your-model-name

(Without this AI answers will not work, only data fetching will work)

---

2. RUNNING THE PROJECT

---

Start backend:

uvicorn main:app --reload

Server will start on:
http://127.0.0.1:8000

Open in browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

You can now test APIs.

3. WHAT EACH FILE DOES

---

main.py
The brain of the system.
It:
• reads user question
• finds keywords like ward, road, drain etc
• searches database
• sends data to AI
• returns answer

setup.py
One-time starter file.
It creates the database and checks everything is installed.

init_db.py
Creates the PROJECT_DATA table inside SQLite.
Basically builds the structure of storage.

DATA_DB.db
The actual storage.
All project records live here.

.env
Stores secret API key safely.

---

4. HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS (Simple Flow)

---

User asks question
↓
System finds filters (ward / project / status)
↓
Database searched
↓
Matching projects found
↓
Sent to AI for explanation
↓
Clean human readable answer returned

---

5. IMPORTANT NOTES

---

• No local AI runs on your PC
• Database is the source of truth
• AI only explains the data
• If no record found → it tells user nothing exists

That's it. You now have a civic transparency backend.
